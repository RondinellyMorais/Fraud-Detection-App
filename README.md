## Bussines Problem.
<p align="justify"> Let's take Blocker Fraude Company as an example to analyze our business problem. Blocker Fraude Company is a company specialized in the detection of fraud in financial transactions made through mobile devices. The company has a service called “Blocker Fraud” which guarantees the blocking of fraudulent transactions. </p>

<p align="justify"> And the company's business model is of the Service type, with monetization made by the performance of the service provided, that is, the user pays a fixed fee on the success in detecting fraud in the client's transactions. </p>

<p align="justity"> However, Blocker Fraud Company is expanding in Brazil and in order to acquire customers more quickly, it has adopted a very aggressive strategy. The strategy works as follows: </p>

 1. **The company will receive 25% of the value of each transaction that is truly detected as fraud.** 

 2. **The company will receive 5% of the value of each transaction detected as fraud, however the transaction is truly legitimate.** 

 3. **The company will return 100% of the value to the customer for each transaction detected as legitimate, however the transaction is truly a fraud.**

<p align="justity"> With this aggressive strategy, the company assumes the risks of failing to detect fraud and is remunerated for assertively detecting fraud. </p>

## Bussines Assumptions.

 * Currently fraud rates remain at record highs all the world, with total cost of these crimes are around US$42 billion.
 * And 13% of companies and other organizations those who’d experienced a fraud said they’d lost US$50 million-plus.
 * A small proportion of these losses are ever recovered, compromised financial institutions and personal impact for bank clients.
 * The global data protection market, valued at 15 billion US dollars in 2020, is forecast to grow by more than 30 percent between 2020 and 2027 annually, [according to Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/data-protection-as-a-service-market).
 * Due to the large amount of fraud and large volume of company losses, solutions for detecting fraudulent events become extremely necessary.
 
 ## Solution Strategy
 **Step 01. Data Description** Firstly, we loading the dataset and take overview about columns and rows. </p>
 **Step 02. Data filtering** We checking for missing data in dataset  and checking possible useless columns that do not contain information to modeling.</p>
 **Step 03. Exploratory Data Analysis** We explore the data to find outliers, insights to understand better the data and other points relevant to modeling. </p>
 **Step 04. Data Preparation** Prepare the date so that machine learning models can learn the specific behavior. </p>
 **Step 05. Feature Selection** Selection of the most significant attributes to train model. </p>
 **Step 06. Machine Learning Modelling** Building machine learning train </p>
 **Step 07. Choose the Best Machine Learning Model** Training some machine learning models and choose the model with best performance. </p>
 **Step 08. Convert Model Performance to Bussines Values** Convert the metrics scores of model performance in business practical results. </p>
 **Step 09. Deploy the Model to Production**
