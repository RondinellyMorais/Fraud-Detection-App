## Bussines Problem.
<p align="justify"> Let's take Blocker Fraude Company as an example to analyze our business problem. Blocker Fraude Company is a company specialized in the detection of fraud in financial transactions made through mobile devices. The company has a service called “Blocker Fraud” which guarantees the blocking of fraudulent transactions. </p>

<p align="justify"> And the company's business model is of the Service type, with monetization made by the performance of the service provided, that is, the user pays a fixed fee on the success in detecting fraud in the client's transactions. </p>

<p align="justity"> However, Blocker Fraud Company is expanding in Brazil and in order to acquire customers more quickly, it has adopted a very aggressive strategy. The strategy works as follows: </p>

 1. **The company will receive 25% of the value of each transaction that is truly detected as fraud.** 

 2. **The company will receive 5% of the value of each transaction detected as fraud, however the transaction is truly legitimate.** 

 3. **The company will return 100% of the value to the customer for each transaction detected as legitimate, however the transaction is truly a fraud.**

<p align="justity"> With this aggressive strategy, the company assumes the risks of failing to detect fraud and is remunerated for assertively detecting fraud. </p>

## Bussines Assumptions.

 * Currently fraud rates remain at record highs all the world, with total cost of these crimes are around US$42 billion.
 * And 13% of companies and other organizations those who’d experienced a fraud said they’d lost US$50 million-plus.
 * A small proportion of these losses are ever recovered, compromised financial institutions and personal impact for bank clients.
 * The global data protection market, valued at 15 billion US dollars in 2020, is forecast to grow by more than 30 percent between 2020 and 2027 annually, [according to Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/data-protection-as-a-service-market).
 * Due to the large amount of fraud and large volume of company losses, solutions for detecting fraudulent events become extremely necessary.
